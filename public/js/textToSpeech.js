    "Ideal vacuum is a chamber or container completely devoid of matter like gas molecules. But this will never happen. Generally speaking, vacuum refers to a chamber or container with less than 1 atmosphere (atm) of pressure. The measurement of vacuum is thus taken using pressure inside the chamber or container. We know that atmospheric pressure is about 10,325 Pascal, 10",
    "Per our discussions on the electron sources and optics,  TEM cannot operate in air for a number of reasons. Specifically, barely any electrons can be emitted without vacuum because of the filament materials would be oxidized in the air. Poor vacuum will significant reduce the file of the electron source. Without vacuum, electron beam cannot travel through the column because of the strong interaction between electrons and gas molecules in the air, which would result in arching, inelastic scattering by gas molecules, gas ionization, intensity or probe current reduction. Without vacuum or with poor vacuum, the thin TEM specimen could easily be contaminated and oxidized. Thus, high vacuum at a magnitude of 10-6 torr or higher is required for a TEM column or thermionic gun. Ultrahigh vacuum at a magnitude of 10-9 or higher is required for FEG gun. How can we generate high or ultrahigh vacuum in a TEM system?",
    "The most basic vacuum system consists of a vessel connected to a pump that removes the air. The vacuum system in a TEM is considerably more complicated, containing a number of vessels, pumps, valves (to separate different vessels) and gauges (to measure vacuum pressures). From the bottom up we can distinguish four vessels in the vacuum system: ",
    "Apparently A TEM is not pumped by single pump, because there is no pump available that handle the full range in vacuum from air pressure (as present after a vessel has been vented) to ultra-high vacuum (in specimen are or gun). The microscope can in essence be divided in two parts, separated by a very small aperture (200 micrometers), the differential pumping aperture, located between the projection chamber and the column. The lower part basically consists of the projection chamber where we observe the image and where plate camera and TV cameras are located. This is pumped by an oil-diffusion pump. Behind the oildiffusion pump is a rotary pump (the oil-diffusion pump cannot go from vacuum to air, it needs some other pump to back it up). Since the rotary (or pre-vacuum) pump is noisy, it is not running continuously but only when needed. In order to have continuous backing of the diffusion, there is a buffer tank in between them. The buffer tank is slowly filled by the oil-diffusion pump. When its pressure is becoming high, it is emptied by the rotary pump. The upper part consists of the specimen and gun areas which are pumped by one or more ion-getter pumps. These pumps use no oil and are therefore clean. They also achieve higher vacuum than the oildiffusion pump. The number of ion-getter pumps may range from one to four. Initial pumping of the column and gun on many systems is done by the rotary and oil-diffusion pumps, except for systems equipped with a turbo-molecular pump. In the latter case the oil-diffusion and rotary pumps never pump on the column and gun areas.",

    "When selecting a vacuum pump, the application is key – you should ask things like, “what pressures do I need?”, “how fast do I need my pumping/venting cycles to be?”, “what gases will I need to pump?”, “how clean does my vacuum need to be?” and (of course) “what is an appropriate price-point?”.",
    "In TEM, a dry diaphragm vacuum pump is used for rough pumping to reduce contamination. Diaphragm vacuum pumps are dry positive-displacement pumps. A crankshaft-driven connecting rod moves the diaphragm that is tensioned between the head cover and the housing. The space between the head cover and the diaphragm forms the suction chamber. Diaphragm pumps require inlet valves and outlet valves to achieve targeted gas displacement. Pressure-controlled shutter valves made of elastomer materials are used as valves. Since the suction chamber is hermetically sealed off from the drive by the diaphragm, the pump medium can neither be contaminated by oil nor can aggressive media corrode the mechanics. The dead volume between the outlet valve and the suction chamber results in a restricted compression ratio which means that with just one pumping stage it is only possible to achieve an ultimate pressure of approximately 52.5 Torr. Connecting multiple pumping stages in series makes it possible to attain an ultimate pressure of 0.38 Torr. Lower pressures cannot be achieved, as in this case there is no longer sufficient force to open the inlet valve. The principle of the diaphragm pump is particularly well suited for low pumping speeds of up to approximately 10 m",

    "The scroll pump uses two scrolls that do not rotate, but where the inner one orbits and traps a volume of gas and compresses it in an ever decreasing volume; compressing it until it reaches a minimum volume and maximum pressure at the spirals’ center, where the outlet is located. A spiral polymer (PTFE) tip seal provides axial sealing between the two scrolls without the use of a lubricant in the swept gas stream. A typical ultimate pressure of 1 x 10",
    "To keep a dry rough pump in good working order, regular inspection and maintenance should be performed. Always consult the manuals provided with your pump, as what follows is only a general guide intended to give you an idea of the process, rather than exact instructions.",
    "Here are some basic trouble-shooting procedures for common faults found in dry scroll pumps. Remember to always consult the manual for your specific pump, as these are only general guidelines. \u000b\u000bIf a pump fails to start, you should first ensure that it is connected to a proper power supply. Ensure all connections are snug, and inspect fuses and breakers. If you believe the pump is connected properly, ensure that the supplied voltage matches the voltage the motor was configured for. If this is correct, it is possible that your motor is faulty, or that the pump has begun to overheat and shut down to prevent this. \u000b\u000bIf your pump starts, but suffers from poor performance, you should check for air leaks, vacuum gauge reading errors, dirty or damaged vacuum fittings, a blocked inlet strainer, or a blocked exhaust line. If these are all satisfactory, you may have trace vapors lingering in your pump, or you may be trying to operate outside the pump’s specifications. Ensure that your gas-ballast control is properly closed, and that your tip seals are in good condition. Additionally, ensure the supplied voltage is adequate – if it is close enough to get your pump to start, but is more than 10% less than the specified minimum voltage, your pump will suffer from poor performance. \u000b\u000b",
    "If your pump is noisy, your bearings may be wearing out, or you may have solid particles contaminating your pump. Either of these issues should be addressed quickly to avoid further damage to your pump.",

    "Oil diffusion pumps offer maximum pump rates of 1000 liters per second (1 cubic meter per second), and can not operate above 10E-2 Torr, in order to ensure that the oil is not vaporized. ",
    "Here is a quick troubleshooting guide for basic problems with oil diffusion pumps -- remember to consult your own manual should you ever need to do so. ",
    "Turbomolecular pumps (or TMPs) use blades rotating at high speeds to transfer energy to gas molecules. \u000b\u000bThe rotor stacks deflect the molecules through the pump during their rotation using specially angled blades, which drive the molecules towards the exhaust. \u000b\u000bThis rotation can occur at non-trivial speeds, between 20 and 60,000 RPM, and will move 50 - 500 L of gas per second.

",
    "\u000bThe need for a backing pump is brought about by the fact that the TMP blades could catastrophically fail if exposed to low vacuum when operating at full speed. The pump will begin to spin down as soon as the pressure increase is detected, but the spin-down times for TMPs are anywhere between several to tens of minutes, so it may not occur in time to prevent blade or motor damage. \u000b\u000bIf you notice abnormal noises or vibrations from your TMP, you should stop operation immediately and consult your manufacturer's documentation, as there may be bearing problems that could result in damage to the pump. \u000b\u000bIf your pump only spins up to 20 - 30 percent of its maximum speed, inspect the hoses and chamber gaskets for leaks and debris, or signs of aging.

    "Here’s a reference for TMP troubleshooting, but, again, consult the documentation for your specific pump. ",
    "The IGP was used in almost every single vacuum application in high vacuum pressure ranges of up to <10",

    "Ion getter pumps use a four-step process to remove gases from the vacuum chamber.",
    "IGP’s alone are not enough to keep the vacuum in the TEM optimally clean, however, since water and other contaminants are still introduced into the column during every specimen exchange despite our best efforts to prevent this. By placing a plate of liquid-nitrogen cooled metal in the space around the specimen, we create a surface on which any stray gases or vapors degrading our vacuum may condense and stick until the plate is warmed. Of course this means contaminants have to be in the space immediately around the cold trap to be captured by it, but it is primarily intended to capture those that come in with our specimen holder, and its shape and position in the specimen area make it quite effective. ",

    "And, even once you have clean, stable vacuum, you must still have a way to accurately measure it so that you can verify and monitor it. To do this, you need vacuum gauges, but just like we saw with vacuum pumps, there is no one gauge that can give accurate measurements from atmospheric pressure to UHV -- we again need to rely on a series of devices, in this case, gauges. ",
    "A Penning gauge, which you will also hear called a “cold cathode” gauge can be used to measure medium and high vacuum, between 1 - 1E-7 Pa. It does this by creating a flow of ions between between electrodes within a chamber open to the vacuum, and using the ion current from cathode to anode as a measure of pressure.",

    "Since we can expect to encounter air-locks on every TEM, is is worthwhile to discuss how to load and remove specimens into and out of a TEM! \u000b\u000bAfter loading the specimen into the holder, and ensuring that the specimen is firmly secured, take time to examine the holder’s o-ring and mating surfaces, which need to clean and in good condition to allow proper sealing to take place. \u000b\u000bMake sure that the column valve is closed, so that if anything does go wrong, the gun will be safe. \u000b\u000bTurn on the TMP through the control software, and allow it to start pre-pumping the liner tubes. \u000b\u000bUse the small pin near the end of the holder to align the rod with the markings on the Compustage goniometer. For our microscope, this occurs around the 5 o’clock position. \u000b\u000bAfter insertion, the TMP will pump the specimen, holder, and airlock down close to column vacuum levels, at which point you can complete the insertion by turning the older anti-clockwise to open the ball-valve in the airlock, and allowing the holder to be slowly pushed into the airlock. The column pressure will increase, and fluctuate as it is pumped back down -- only open the column valve once safe and stable pressures have been reached. ",
