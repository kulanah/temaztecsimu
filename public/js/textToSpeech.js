    +
    "\n"
    +

    +
    "\n"
    +
    "\n"
    +
    "And, again, since it’s entirely a size restriction, it commonly involves the ability to see and control individual atoms and molecules. This is problematic, however, since something as small as an atom is impossible to see with the naked eye, and the instruments typically used in a high school science lab won’t help either. "
    +
    "\n"

    "To give you a sense of the scales we’re talking about: \u000b\u000bthe Bohr radius, which is the distance between the nucleus and the electron of a ground-state hydrogen atom, is about 0.05 nanometers. So we can think of this as the distance between the subatomic components of an atom."
    +
    "\n"
    +
    "\n"
    +
    "And, scaling up, the Van der Waals radius of a carbon atom is 0.17 nanometers, meaning that half of the distance between two unbonded carbon atoms is 0.17 nanometers – so, if we were to let individual carbon atoms roll around, they would always remain separated by around 0.25 nm. \u000b\u000bUsing these general ideas about the distances between the components of the atom, and the distances between the atoms, then, we can more readily appreciate the fact that a 1 nanometer line could be “drawn” with 3 carbon atoms. "
    +
    "\n"
    +
    "\n"

    "\u000bAnd, likewise, a 1 nm by 1 nm by 1 nm cube could be constructed with just 27 C atoms.  So one cubic nanometer is just twenty seven carbon atoms! \u000b\u000bA cubic millimeter, however, is 2.7E28 carbon atoms.

    "If all three dimensions are less than 100 nm, we call them “3D nanomaterials” – nanomaterials of this type include nanoparticles, quantum dots, and nano-onions; some functional examples include gold nanoparticles, cadmium-selenide quantum dots, and carbon nano-onions. "

Essentially, we can see a dozen or so techniques here, yet when we examine techniques capable of preforming analyses of materials smaller than 100 nm, we see there’re only a few – FIB, or focused-ion beam; AFM, or atomic force microscopy; SEM; and, far at the end there, with the smallest analytical spot size available, is TEM/STEM. So if we need quantitative analysis at the nanoscale, we’re already restricted to just AFM, FIB, and electron microscopy, and if we want to investigate phenomena occurring in the smallest extremes between 5 and 0.1 nanometers we’ll be restricted to TEM/STEM.

    "So, if we compare visible light, transmission electron, and scanning electron microscopes, we’ll see that things are fairly similar looking – at the very top, we have some sort of radiation source. A light bulb, maybe, for LM, supplying us with visible photons. For TEM and SEM we use special electron sources, which will be discussed in the next chapter, but these are still just acting as radiation sources that provide illumination. That’s not the only difference, however – think about lenses! In LM we use glass lenses, but we can’t use those in TEM (for many reasons that you’ll learn about in chapter 3), so instead we use electronically adjustable electromagnetic lenses."
    +
    "\n"
    +
    "\n"
    +
    "We can see that in all of the microscopes shown the rays emitted from the source enter a condenser lens – glass in LM and electromagnetic in TEM and SEM --  and are focused into convergent or divergent beams, depending on the properties of the lens. In LM and TEM the rays will come right out of the condenser lens and hit, or “impinge” on a very thin sample with a thickness between several and one hundred nanometers, before passing (or being “transmitted”, hence the T in TEM) through it, down into an objective system, then perhaps through some diffraction and projection lenses in TEM, before being spit out by a final projection lens as an image in both cases. SEMs are a little different, since they don’t rely on transmission to produce images, but instead use scanning and digitization to construct a picture of a surface. "
    +
    "\n"
    +
    "\n"
    ,
    "So, to quantitatively compare the differences between a LM and a TEM: \u000b\u000b\tLMs use photons, while TEMs use electrons. This brings us to our next point of comparison: the wavelength of the source radiation. The photons used in VLM are by definition restricted to wavelengths between 400 to 800 nanometers, meaning the wavelength of a VLM photon is already at least 4 times larger than the largest nanostructure we’d want to image! "
    +
    "\n"
    +
    "\n"
    +
    "The electrons used in TEM, however, have an ideal wavelength far below one nanometer, coming in at 0.00254 nanometers at 200 kilovolts of acceleration. \u000b\u000bThese electrons, however, must be contained under specialized conditions. In VLM air or immersion oil are frequently used as optical media – in TEM, this would be impossible. Electrons won’t be useful to us unless they’re kept within a vacuum chamber, so for TEM we consider our “medium” to be the vacuum. Vacuum systems are also one of the factors contributing to the cost of purchase, installation, and maintenance of a TEM. "
    +
    "\n"
    +
    "\n"
    +
    "And, as we already mentioned, VLM uses glass lenses whereas TEM uses electromagnetic or electrostatic lensing. "
    +
    "\n"
    +
    "\n"
    +
    "Aperture angles are also starkly different, with those in VLM generally being less than sixty degrees, while those in TEM are less than one degree. "
    +
    "\n"
    +
    "\n"
    +
    "Contrast is achieved in LM through the absorption, reflection, scattering, diffraction, or fluorescence of visible light. In TEM, though, it is achieved through the interactions of electrons – namely mass-thickness, diffraction, Z contrast, and phase. "
    +
    "\n"
    +
    "\n"
    +
    "All of these factors result in the vastly different “resolving power”, or ability to produce images that contain distinguishable objects rather than blurry messes. For a LM, anything smaller than 200 nm can’t really be distinguished in an image. In modern TEMs, however, we can image sub-Angstrom features! "
    +
    "\n"
    +
    "\n"
    +
    "Depth of field can be thought of as a way to describe the “through-page” distance between in-focus objects, and it is also quite different between the two instruments! With a LM we can expect a depth of field of around 10 microns at best, meaning that if there are deviations in the surface texture of the specimen that are near or more than ten nanometers, the specimen won’t be in focus – only parts will be. In a TEM, though, we have a distance of about 100 nanometers or more wherein every detail can be seen in crisp focus. "
    +
    "\n"
    +
    "\n"
    +
    "These last three facts should really drive home the advantages of TEM over VLM in nanocharacterization applications – with superior resolving power and depth of field, the TEM can literally give an unparalleled picture of the material you’re working with.  "
    +
    "\n"
    ,
    "TEM offer very powerful magnification and resolution"

    "\n"

    "TEM have a wide range applications"

    "\n"
    +
    "\n"
    +
    "\n"
    +
    "The differences between TEM and SEM are a little less stark, but they still exist and make it easy to see why each technique is invaluable to the nanotechnologist in its own right. "
    +
    "\n"
    +
    "\n"
    +
    "SEMs work through detection of information about the specimen surface, while TEMs detect information through the entire specimen. This of course has practical considerations in that an SEM specimen could be a piece of minimally prepared bulk material, a FIB-milled cross-section of a semiconductor device, or even an entire silicon wafer. TEM specimens, however, usually require extensive preparation before they are thin enough to be examined. "
    +
    "\n"
    +
    "\n"
    +
    "SEMs also have a spatial resolution that is a quite a bit poorer than TEM – with about 0.4 nm being the lower limit of SEM, and 0.069 nm being the lower limit of TEM. "
    +
    "\n"
    +
    "Likewise, the spatial resolution of composition analyses in SEM is limited to a micron to a few hundred nanometers at best, while TEMs are able to give atomic resolution analyses. "
    +
    "\n"
    +
    "\n"
    +
    "The signals they rely on for data acquisition are also different – SEMs rely mainly on secondary and backscattered electrons, while TEMs use transmitted and diffracted electrons. Both systems, however, use X-ray detection for quantification. "
    +
    "\n"
    +
    "\n"
    +
    "And, as was mentioned earlier, the images are formed in different ways; SEMs “raster” or regularly scan the electron beam in a series of parallel lines across the surface of the sample – this makes them fairly dissimilar from both TEMs and VLMs, since these techniques are static and require the transmission of radiation through the specimen. Many modern TEMs also have the ability to raster their beam, however, since this is the basis of “STEM” or scanning-transmission electron microscopy. \u000b\u000bAnd, since the images are formed differently, they give us different data: SEM images are 3D, while TEM images are 2D.

    "Of course, the TEM is a much more recent invention than the VLM – in fact, the first demonstration of imaging with a TEM occurred less than one hundred years ago, in 1932! Of course prior to that important work was done that allowed the TEM to come into being; de Broglie’s 1923 PhD thesis postulated the wave-particle duality of the electron, and the wave properties of all matter – this, along with Clinton Davisson and Lester Germer discovery of electron diffraction a few years later in 1927, began to paint a picture of the electron as a potentially useful particle for optical applications. \u000b\u000bThe first electronmicrograph was demonstrated by Ruska and Knoll in 1932, and shortly thereafter in 1936 the first commercial TEM, the Metropolitan-Viskers EM1, went into production in the UK."

    "The silicon drift detector (SDD) is fabricated from high-purity silicon with a large area contact on the entrance side. On the opposite side is a central small anode contact, which is surrounded by a number of concentric drift electrodes. When a bias is applied to the SDD detector chip and the detector is exposed to X-rays, it converts each X-ray detected to an electron cloud with a charge that is proportional to the characteristic energy of that X-ray. These electrons are then “drifted” down a field gradient applied between the drift rings, and are collected at the anode."

    +
    "Unlike a Si(Li) detector, however, the size of the anode on an SDD is small when compared to the entrance contact. This results in lower capacitance and lower voltage noise. Therefore, short time constants can be used to minimize the effect of leakage current, so that higher temperature Peltier cooling can be used instead of LN2. This also means excellent resolution is achieved even at short process/shaping times and at count rates much higher than conventional Si(Li) detectors. This gives distinct advantages when applied to the TEM in that the safety issues regarding LN2 are eliminated, and the ability to tolerate high count rates in the order of ~ 500,000 cps allows moving over grids, bars etc. without saturating the detector. Also, large-area sensors facilitate larger solid angles than Si(Li) detectors, which are limited to 50 mm² diameter if reasonable resolution is to be retained. SDDs have better resolution than Si(Li)s, especially at higher count rates, and low-energy X-rays show peak resolutions that are largely unattainable with Si(Li)detectors. In only a few years, SDDs have become the detector of choice for most TEM users and have superseded Si(Li) in all applications. Even SDDs need to be protected from high electron flux so in situations such as low-magnification mode, the detector is automatically retracted to increase its lifetime"

This is what we see illustrated at left, but, remember, we can alter the vertical position of the pattern and view it as an image using the intermediate lens.  This is because diffraction patterns and images are simultaneously present in the TEM -- we can choose to view one or the other. To do that we simply adjust our apertures and intermediate lens so that the diffraction pattern is the lens’ object. This is the way to decide which -- image or diffraction pattern -- is magnified by the projection lens and viewed on the viewing screen. Thus, switching from real space (image) to reciprocal space (diffraction pattern is easily achieved by changing the strength of the intermediate lens.\u000b\u000bIf we compare the imaging set-up at left to the diffraction set-up at right, we see the only differences are the objective and SAED apertures, and the intermediate lens current, which is stronger at left and weaker at right, allowing the diffraction pattern to be projected onto the phosphor screen.

However, if we examine the interaction volumes, we see that signal generation in SEM EDS occurs within a sphere of diameter of approximately one nanometer.  TEM EDS, on the other hand, has an interaction volume that is between half a micron and one nanometer. This difference is mainly due to two things: one having to do with the sample, and one having to do with the probe. \u000b\u000bIn the sample prep.

    "Per our discussions on the electron sources and optics,  TEM cannot operate in air for a number of reasons. Specifically, barely any electrons can be emitted without vacuum because of the filament materials would be oxidized in the air. Poor vacuum will significant reduce the file of the electron source. Without vacuum, electron beam cannot travel through the column because of the strong interaction between electrons and gas molecules in the air, which would result in arching, inelastic scattering by gas molecules, gas ionization, intensity or probe current reduction. Without vacuum or with poor vacuum, the thin TEM specimen could easily be contaminated and oxidized. Thus, high vacuum at a magnitude of 10-6 torr or higher is required for a TEM column or thermionic gun. Ultrahigh vacuum at a magnitude of 10-9 or higher is required for FEG gun. How can we generate high or ultrahigh vacuum in a TEM system?"

Above PVP is the buffer tank, separated by a valve (V1) from the PVP. Another valve (V2) is also closed. When open this would give the PVP access to the projection chamber (the area above V3, the valve that separates it from the oil-diffusion pump ODP). Pir (Pir 1 and Pir 2) and Pen (3) stand for Pirani and Penning which are vacuum-pressure measuring gauges. Valve 4 (closed) separates the projection chamber from the upper part of the column. Pressures are also measured on the basis of the current running in the IGPs. The large cyan area represents the TEM column or specimen area (as well as some connecting pipes), pumped by a main ion-getter pump (IGP1) and the liner-tube ion-getter pump (IGP4) (liner tubes are thin pipes that connect the projection chamber to the specimen area and the specimen area to the gun). At the same height, to the right, is the turbo-molecular pump (Turbo) that is used to prepump the specimen and gun areas and also pumps on the specimen-holder airlock (on the CompuStage; through the line that is drawn over the top, towards valves 42 and 8). The gun is pumped by two ion-getter pumps (IGP2 and IGP3). IGP3 measured by voltage pumps the FEG tip area."

    "Apparently A TEM is not pumped by single pump, because there is no pump available that handle the full range in vacuum from air pressure (as present after a vessel has been vented) to ultra-high vacuum (in specimen are or gun). The microscope can in essence be divided in two parts, separated by a very small aperture (200 micrometers), the differential pumping aperture, located between the projection chamber and the column. The lower part basically consists of the projection chamber where we observe the image and where plate camera and TV cameras are located. This is pumped by an oil-diffusion pump. Behind the oildiffusion pump is a rotary pump (the oil-diffusion pump cannot go from vacuum to air, it needs some other pump to back it up). Since the rotary (or pre-vacuum) pump is noisy, it is not running continuously but only when needed. In order to have continuous backing of the diffusion, there is a buffer tank in between them. The buffer tank is slowly filled by the oil-diffusion pump. When its pressure is becoming high, it is emptied by the rotary pump. The upper part consists of the specimen and gun areas which are pumped by one or more ion-getter pumps. These pumps use no oil and are therefore clean. They also achieve higher vacuum than the oildiffusion pump. The number of ion-getter pumps may range from one to four. Initial pumping of the column and gun on many systems is done by the rotary and oil-diffusion pumps, except for systems equipped with a turbo-molecular pump. In the latter case the oil-diffusion and rotary pumps never pump on the column and gun areas."

Since the suction chamber is hermetically sealed off from the drive by the diaphragm, the pump medium can neither be contaminated by oil nor can aggressive media corrode the mechanics.

Remember to always consult the manual for your specific pump, as these are only general guidelines. \u000b\u000bIf a pump fails to start, you should first ensure that it is connected to a proper power supply. Ensure all connections are snug, and inspect fuses and breakers. If you believe the pump is connected properly, ensure that the supplied voltage matches the voltage the motor was configured for. If this is correct, it is possible that your motor is faulty, or that the pump has begun to overheat and shut down to prevent this. \u000b\u000bIf your pump starts, but suffers from poor performance, you should check for air leaks, vacuum gauge reading errors, dirty or damaged vacuum fittings, a blocked inlet strainer, or a blocked exhaust line. If these are all satisfactory, you may have trace vapors lingering in your pump, or you may be trying to operate outside the pump’s specifications. Ensure that your gas-ballast control is properly closed, and that your tip seals are in good condition. Additionally, ensure the supplied voltage is adequate – if it is close enough to get your pump to start, but is more than 10% less than the specified minimum voltage, your pump will suffer from poor performance. \u000b\u000b"
