<h3><font color="#7451FF">Gun tilt</font></h3>

<p><b>Purpose:</b> The gun tilt makes sure that the
electron beam from the gun comes down parallel to the optical
axis, so that no electrons from the beam are lost before they can
be used for imaging, etc.<br>
<b>Importance</b>: <font color="#FF0000"><b>ESSENTIAL</b></font>
for having sufficient beam intensity.<br>
<b>Method:</b> Obtain maximum intensity.</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>Advice: </b>The gun alignment is sensitive to the 
gun lens setting. In general do the alignment with a gun lens selected for a 
specific mode (TEM or STEM).</font><br>
</p>

<p><font color="#7451FF"><b>Procedure<br>
</b></font>The gun tilt alignment consists of two steps : </p>

<ul>
    <li>A step for preparation and finding light.</li>
    <li>A step to set the gun tilt itself.</li>
</ul>

<p><br>
<font color="#7451FF"><b>Description<br>
</b></font>Gun alignment consists of two parts: gun tilt and
<a href="e05a0093.htm">gun shift</a>. The gun tilt alignment
makes sure that the electron beam enters the microscope (that is,
the C1 - spot size - lens) parallel to the optical axis, while
gun shift ensures that the beam goes through the center of the C1
lens. <br>

<p><br>
The gun tilt is aligned simply by maximizing the intensity (with
a useful guide often being the exposure time measured on the
screen). For fine-tuning observe the position of the bright spot
in a focused beam. When it is centered, the gun is properly
aligned.</p>

<p>Since gun tilt alignment implies no gun shift (which would be
visible as a beam shift), it should be possible to align the gun
tilt without movement of the beam. If this is not the case, the <a
href="e05a0089.htm">gun tilt pivot points</a> are not aligned
properly.</p>
