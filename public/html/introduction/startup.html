        </div>

	    <p>To begin, we will have to click “Microscope Setup” button to bring up the Microscope Setup Window – this is where we’ll see the fluorescence screen output. </p>

        <p>Click the “Microscope Controls” button to view the two control panels and the aperture knobs. </p>

        <p>Click the clicking the yellow “Col. Valves Closed” button within the simulated TEM User Interface software to open the column valves.</p>

        <p>Click the left control panel’s “L3” button twice – this will change the spot size setting from 5 to 3. </p>

        <p>Click, hold, and drag the left hand control panel’s “beam shift” trackball to (roughly) center the beam over the large black circle within the microscope setup window.</p>

        <p>Click the “eucentric focus” button on the right hand control panel to optimize the objective lens current. </p>

        <p>Click and drag the “magnification” knob until the displayed magnification reads: “34000 x”. </p>


        <p>Use the “beam shift trackball” to re-center the beam over the central circles. </p>

        <p>Use the left hand control panel’s “intensity” knob to converge the beam to a small point, and verify that this point is within the Microscope Setup Window’s innermost black circle. </p>


        <p>If it is not, correct the positioning using the “beam shift” trackball.</p>
 
        <p>Click and drag the “magnification” knob until the displayed magnification reads: “125k x”.</p>

        <p>Re-center the beam with the “beam shift” trackball if necessary.  </p>

        <p>Use the “intensity” knob to diverge the beam until it is only slightly larger than the inner black circle. </p>

        <p>Inspect its shape to ensure that it is as circular as possible. </p>

        <p>If it is not circular, click the “Stigmator” button on the left hand control panel. </p>

            <span class='caption'>Condenser Stigmation</span>
        </div>
        <p>Within the new “Stigmator” popup window, click the “Condenser” button. </p>
        <p>Carefully adjust the two “multi-function” knobs on the left and right control panels until the beam is as circular as you can manage.  </p>

        <p>Click “None” within the stigmator popup window to finish the adjustment. </p>

        <p>Click the “Stigmator” button on the left hand control panel to close the popup window. </p>
