<h3><font color="#7451FF">Gun shift</font></h3>

<p><b>Purpose:</b> Shift the electron beam sideways so
that it comes down along the optical axis.<br>
<b>Importance:</b> <font color="#FF0000"><b>ESSENTIAL</b></font>
for minimizing movements between different spot sizes and for
having the beam correctly along the optical axis for all spot
sizes.<br>
<b>Method:</b> Minimize spot displacement when spot
size (that is focal length of C1 lens) is changed. <br>
</p>

<p><font color="#7451FF"><b>Procedure<br>
</b></font>The gun shift alignment consists of two steps : </p>

<ul>
    <li>A first step in which spot 6 is centered with the beam
        deflection coils.</li>
    <li>A second step in which spot 2 is centered with the gun
        deflection coils. </li>
</ul>

<p>The two steps are repeated until the change in gun shift is
very small. In the gun shift procedure the <a href="e05a009d.htm">spot-size
dependent gun shif</a>t values for spots 2 and 6 are reset to
zero (for proper alignment the spot-size dependent gun shift
should therefore be done after the gun shift procedure).</p>

<p><br>
<font color="#7451FF"><b>Description<br>
</b></font>Gun alignment consists of two parts: <a
href="e05a0075.htm">gun tilt</a> and gun shift. The gun tilt
alignment makes sure that the electron beam enters the microscope
(that is, the C1 - spot size - lens) parallel to the optical
axis, while gun shift ensures that the beam goes through the
center of the C1 lens. <br>

<p>When spot size 6 is used (or any spot size above that), the C1
lens is strong. Under these conditions all aberrations of the
microscope system above it are demagnified by the lens (C1 works
in the opposite way of the magnification system; instead of
magnifying the image, it makes the image of the source - the
electron gun - smaller). Thus the demagnification of the
misalignment of the gun shift is much smaller for spot 6 than for
spot 2, so spot 6 gives the reference ('no' gun shift) and spot 2
defines the gun shift itself. </p>

<p>These diagrams show schematically how the beam position would
change as a function of spot number when spots 3 and 9 are used
for gun shift alignment (left) and spots 1 and 11 (right). For
spots 3 and 9 (2 and 6 for FEG) the overall shift is smaller. The
remaining deviations are corrected by the <a href="e05a009d.htm">spot-size
dependent gun shift</a>.</p>
