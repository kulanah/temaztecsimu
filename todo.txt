Bugs: 
- Safari compatibility (pretty sure there's a small syntax error somewhere that's breaking the whole thing)
- onclick mouse capture is breaking the scroll bars
- rounding error in FEG Control mewA
- setup buttons hide if screen shrinks
- text DOESNT shrinks if you resize window
- on aws downloads my object instead of displaying it

Backlog:
- responsive design for everything 
- shrink text at small resolution
- gun tilt from alignments makes mx/my shift birghtness circle (to be added)
- add window switch function
- make classes or some kind of parent organization for subsets of page
- add draggable to controls (causes issues with drag, can potentially remove draggable when the templates are hit)
- alignmnet boxes should be exactly the same
- aplly classes for the flagged buttons to disable unused buttons to all items
- controller class rewrite

swap diffraction apertture and intermediate lens

new lens between objective and image deflection 1

make column scrollable

long term give pop outs of the each lens at ~3x zoom

TODO:
- R3 and L3 are backwards
- as you increase spotsize diameter of halo gets bigger and brighter
- guntilt will move the halo center X and Y.  This comes from the guntilt in alignments
- gunshift will make multix/y move beam on x and y
- direct alignment will open new box with direct alignments list (but different than search direct alignment) tony will email picture
- shrink controlls to 2/3rd
- up and dwon above focus move focus a little bit
- if you're in wobble these buttons should instead change width and speed
- second from bottom on left controller will activate wobble 
- buttoon to the right of arrows will reset focus to 0
- RESEAERCH REDUX DB   OMMUNICATION PATH

- Lookat minhs updated in google drive

-nanolabsim.com

- Button Highlighting
- PivotPoint functionality
- top left of left control activates stigamator 
  * adds popup with 3 buttons (will get screenshot)

- diffraction button is right control second from right on top

Doing:
- next button on alignment pane (tune tab) and bottom buttons
- qa, examples, hw boxes add -- assigned to minh
- better documentation

Need Clarification:
- further additions to error message? Possibly explain whats wrong? (REQUIRES LOTS OF MANUAL CODE PATHS)
- does pivotpoint move purely randomly?  Does it roughly progress through the elipse?

Done:
- Haloing at various sizes
- when intensity gets too large darken the image
- Spotsize connection to canvases (mask radius)
- setup window canvs is slightly larger than window causing slight issues with overflow
- intensity needs a lower bound
- intensity gets stuck too small
- system for limiting what buttons are active at any given moment set up
- need to create system for error messages (popups when users do things that could be damaging to equipment)
- direct alignments in popup
- direct alignments from dropdwon should open setupbox and controls
- mag needs to be drag up and down like focucs
- paragraphs from alignment doc need to be parsed as json instead of .htm files
  - will have various flags that will change the state of the app
- external buttons are now responsive
- create controls for setup canvas
- can't control different windows in first screen, we can either make a manual selector or let it be the last one interacted with, or only show one at a time.
- create canvas for setup window (still needs distinction about how to be controlled)
- setup and DM are either/or
- add other alignment box
- shrink window ruins setup 
- recreate window for microscope setup
- TEM UI canvas is poorly sized
- add row below windows UI with buttons for non windows functions(controls, column, setup window)
- when intesnsity hits 0 going up wont change anything
- when intensity gets too low mask becomes too small, need to make it reverseable ALA focus 
- intensity is a hto mess on window 0
- siwthc to canvas
- feg register filler too short on laptop
- focus button which should have very small changes (???) 
- add nanolabsim like window
- openbox in window 1 size changes because it's currently set to VW/VH, switch this to static values
- focus doesn't affect mask as it should
- when blur hits 0 going up wont change anything
- focus hits critical point where it drags teh whole page to a crawl 
- focus functions 
- nanoprobe microprobe buttons don't change colors
- create separate function for handling sliders for intensity and focus
- create buttons for l 1,2 and r 1, 2 
- turbo button given on/off state
- r3 and l3 non responsinve 
- sections in alignments is double or triple spaced
- added heihgt/width values to all img tags
- onclicks on popups don't work unless you resize the window
- sort CSS into similar sections as onclicks
- make default hidden css class that allows the "on load hide all this stuff" funciton to be removed
- controls care what window is open
- distinct display box for base image 
- file -> open OR start view open microscope image
- alignment should open help box with htmls in drive -> TEM alignment
