Bugs: 
- on github hosting alignment box expands windows
- when intesnsity hits 0 going up wont change anything
- Safari compatibility (pretty sure there's a small syntax error somewhere that's breaking the whole thing)
- onclick mouse capture is breaking the scroll bars
- feg register filler too short on laptop
- rounding error in FEG Control mewA
- magnification moves center of mask 
- intensity is a hto mess on window 0


TODO:
- add nanolabsim like window

Doing:
- qa, examples, hw boxes add -- assigned to minh
- better documentation

Need Clarification:
- turbo button should noise(???) on ativation
- expand alignment help box data to include all data (do we care?)
- focus button which should have very small changes (???) 
- digital micrograph should open TEM files root name
- tem image + analysis should open STEM files root

Done:
- openbox in window 1 size changes because it's currently set to VW/VH, switch this to static values
- focus doesn't affect mask as it should
- when blur hits 0 going up wont change anything
- focus hits critical point where it drags teh whole page to a crawl 
- focus functions 
- nanoprobe microprobe buttons don't change colors
- create separate function for handling sliders for intensity and focus
- create buttons for l 1,2 and r 1, 2 
- turbo button given on/off state
- r3 and l3 non responsinve 
- sections in alignments is double or triple spaced
- added heihgt/width values to all img tags
- onclicks on popups don't work unless you resize the window
- sort CSS into similar sections as onclicks
- make default hidden css class that allows the "on load hide all this stuff" funciton to be removed
- controls care what window is open
- distinct display box for base image 
- file -> open OR start view open microscope image
- alignment should open help box with htmls in drive -> TEM alignment
