TODO:
- file -> open OR start view open microscope image

Need Clarification:
- focus button which should have very small changes (???) 
- digital micrograph should open TEM files root name
- tem image + analysis should pen STEM files root
- start view should open image same as file -> open or open file button 
- intensity moves center of mask - What is intended behavior here?
