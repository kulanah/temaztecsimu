Backlog:
- BUG: on github hosting alignment box expands windows
- turbo button should have on/off and noise(???) on ativation
- new aws accoutn 
- Safari compatibility (pretty sure there's a small syntax error somewhere that's breaking the whole thing)
- Rotation should move 
- operate on/off - V value goes to 3000 FEG uA to 0 then back to 60
- color mask
- expand alignment help box data to include all data

TODO:
- create separate css classes for different states
- file -> open OR start view open microscope image
- controls care what window is open
- distinct display box for base image 
- sort CSS into similar sections as onclicks

Doing:
- qa, examples, hw boxes add -- assigned to minh
- better documentation
- fix onclick mouse capture that's breaking the scroll bars


Done:
- alignment should open help box with htmls in drive -> TEM alignment

Need Clarification:
- focus button which should have very small changes (???) 
- digital micrograph should open TEM files root name
- tem image + analysis should pen STEM files root
- start view should open image same as file -> open or open file button 
- intensity moves center of mask - What is intended behavior here?
