Backlog:
- Rotation should move 
- operate on/off - V value goes to 3000 FEG uA to 0 then back to 60
- color mask
- shrink text at small resolution
- buttons for qa and hw
- new aws accoutn 
- add window switch function
- make classes or some kind of parent organization for subsets of page

revealjs
videojs

input pprt vidoe and timestamps with above output video or presentation in the form of sample youtube video
ALTERNATIVELY
use vimeo annotations to do this.
ALTERNATIVELY
use js page with embeded youtube link with buttons that link to specific times in vid 

Bugs: 
- Safari compatibility (pretty sure there's a small syntax error somewhere that's breaking the whole thing)
- onclick mouse capture is breaking the scroll bars
- rounding error in FEG Control mewA
- on aws downloads my object instead of displaying it

TODO:
- add highlights to actie buttons
- add haloing when smaller than outer circle from xhair
- when intensity gets too large darken the image
- white spot in center when very small
- top left of left control activates stigamator 
  - adds popup with 3 buttons (will get screenshot)

- add other alignment box
- diffraction button is right control second from right on top
- create canvas for setup window (still needs distinction about how to be controlled)
- magnification moves center of mask 
- mag needs to be drag up and down like focucs
- setup and DM are either or
- shrink window ruins setup 
- z index on setup window

Doing:
- controller class rewrite
- qa, examples, hw boxes add -- assigned to minh
- better documentation

Need Clarification:
- can't control different windows in first screen, we can either make a manual selector or let it be the last one interacted with, or only show one at a time.

Done:
- recreate window for microscope setup
- TEM UI canvas is poorly sized
- add row below windows UI with buttons for non windows functions(controls, column, setup window)
- when intesnsity hits 0 going up wont change anything
- when intensity gets too low mask becomes too small, need to make it reverseable ALA focus 
- intensity is a hto mess on window 0
- siwthc to canvas
- feg register filler too short on laptop
- focus button which should have very small changes (???) 
- add nanolabsim like window
- openbox in window 1 size changes because it's currently set to VW/VH, switch this to static values
- focus doesn't affect mask as it should
- when blur hits 0 going up wont change anything
- focus hits critical point where it drags teh whole page to a crawl 
- focus functions 
- nanoprobe microprobe buttons don't change colors
- create separate function for handling sliders for intensity and focus
- create buttons for l 1,2 and r 1, 2 
- turbo button given on/off state
- r3 and l3 non responsinve 
- sections in alignments is double or triple spaced
- added heihgt/width values to all img tags
- onclicks on popups don't work unless you resize the window
- sort CSS into similar sections as onclicks
- make default hidden css class that allows the "on load hide all this stuff" funciton to be removed
- controls care what window is open
- distinct display box for base image 
- file -> open OR start view open microscope image
- alignment should open help box with htmls in drive -> TEM alignment
