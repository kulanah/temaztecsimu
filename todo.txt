Backlog:
- add highlighting to active buttons (make controllers canvases maybe?)
- Rotation should move 
- operate on/off - V value goes to 3000 FEG uA to 0 then back to 60
- color mask
- shrink text at small resolution
- buttons for qa and hw
- new aws accoutn 
- add window switch function
- make classes or some kind of parent organization for subsets of page
- setup beam should be nonfull opacity
- add draggable to controls (causes issues with drag, can potentially remove draggable when the templates are hit)


Bugs: 
- Safari compatibility (pretty sure there's a small syntax error somewhere that's breaking the whole thing)
- onclick mouse capture is breaking the scroll bars
- rounding error in FEG Control mewA
- setup buttons hide if screen shrinks
- text DOESNT shrinks if you resize window
- on aws downloads my object instead of displaying it

TODO:
- spotsize smaller = darkest @ 11 
- spotsize larger = brighter @ 1
- spot size should modify intensity by some finitie amount per step.
- set classes for the flagged buttons to disable unused buttons


MEETING 
- next button on alignment pane (tune tab) and bottom buttons
- spotsize should connect to display
- beam size smaller in setupbox
- beam size connects to mask size
- make steps equidistant
- alignmnet boxes should be exactly the same
- gun tilt from alignments makes mx/my shift birghtness circle (to be added)
- for multi x is bottom left to top right y is bottom right to top left

- responsive design for everything 
- add haloing when smaller than outer circle from xhair
- when intensity gets too large darken the image
- white spot in center when very small
- top left of left control activates stigamator 
  - adds popup with 3 buttons (will get screenshot)
- diffraction button is right control second from right on top
- magnification moves center of mask 
- controller class rewrite

Doing:
- brightness/fade circle added to canvas classes
- qa, examples, hw boxes add -- assigned to minh
- better documentation

Need Clarification:
- further additions to error message? Possibly explain whats wrong? (REQUIRES LOTS OF MANUAL CODE PATHS)

Done:
- setup window canvs is slightly larger than window causing slight issues with overflow
- intensity needs a lower bound
- intensity gets stuck too small
- system for limiting what buttons are active at any given moment set up
- need to create system for error messages (popups when users do things that could be damaging to equipment)
- direct alignments in popup
- direct alignments from dropdwon should open setupbox and controls
- mag needs to be drag up and down like focucs
- paragraphs from alignment doc need to be parsed as json instead of .htm files
  - will have various flags that will change the state of the app
- external buttons are now responsive
- create controls for setup canvas
- can't control different windows in first screen, we can either make a manual selector or let it be the last one interacted with, or only show one at a time.
- create canvas for setup window (still needs distinction about how to be controlled)
- setup and DM are either/or
- add other alignment box
- shrink window ruins setup 
- recreate window for microscope setup
- TEM UI canvas is poorly sized
- add row below windows UI with buttons for non windows functions(controls, column, setup window)
- when intesnsity hits 0 going up wont change anything
- when intensity gets too low mask becomes too small, need to make it reverseable ALA focus 
- intensity is a hto mess on window 0
- siwthc to canvas
- feg register filler too short on laptop
- focus button which should have very small changes (???) 
- add nanolabsim like window
- openbox in window 1 size changes because it's currently set to VW/VH, switch this to static values
- focus doesn't affect mask as it should
- when blur hits 0 going up wont change anything
- focus hits critical point where it drags teh whole page to a crawl 
- focus functions 
- nanoprobe microprobe buttons don't change colors
- create separate function for handling sliders for intensity and focus
- create buttons for l 1,2 and r 1, 2 
- turbo button given on/off state
- r3 and l3 non responsinve 
- sections in alignments is double or triple spaced
- added heihgt/width values to all img tags
- onclicks on popups don't work unless you resize the window
- sort CSS into similar sections as onclicks
- make default hidden css class that allows the "on load hide all this stuff" funciton to be removed
- controls care what window is open
- distinct display box for base image 
- file -> open OR start view open microscope image
- alignment should open help box with htmls in drive -> TEM alignment
